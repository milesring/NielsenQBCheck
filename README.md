Nielsen Construction uses a single remote server to access financial data.

Currently, the active user will be logged out when a new user logs in.
This "launcher" will replace starting the remote desktop client and report to the included server that a user is currently logged in.

From there, the user can choose to connect anyway or to wait.


Usage:

    The included server must be running. 
    Run the NielsenQBCheck client to check the login status with the server.
